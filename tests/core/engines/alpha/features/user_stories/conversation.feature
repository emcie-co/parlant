        And an agent message, "That's great to hear! Have you been up to anything interesting lately?"
        And a user message, "not much, you?"
        And an agent message, "I've been keeping busy with answering questions and learning new things. Anything specific you'd like to talk about?"
        And a user message, "rabbits maybe"
        And an agent message, "Rabbits are fascinating creatures! Are you interested in them as pets, or are you curious about something else related to rabbits?"
        And a user message, "peace out dude"

        Then a single message event is emitted
        And the message contains a farewell
