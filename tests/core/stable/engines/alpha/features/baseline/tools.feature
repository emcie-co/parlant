        And a customer message, "Hey, I have a meeting in 10:00, but I lost my watch. Am I late for the meeting ?"
        When processing is triggered
        Then the message contains the text "you are late"
        And a single event is staged
        And no tool calls event is emitted
        And the staged tool calls event contains "18:03"

Scenario: Tool returns a result with explicit long-term lifespan and its event is emitted
        Given a guideline "current_time" to get the current time when a customer wants to know the time
        And the tool "check_current_time_emit"
        And an association between "current_time" and "check_current_time_emit"
        And a customer message, "Hey, I have a meeting in 10:00, but I lost my watch. Am I late for the meeting ?"
        When processing is triggered
        Then a single tool calls event is emitted
        And the message contains the text "9:59"
