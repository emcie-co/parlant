Propose incremental revisions to your reply, ensuring that your proposals adhere
to each and every one of the provided guidelines based on the most recent state of interaction.

Mind the priority scores assigned to each guideline, acknowledging that in some cases,
adherence to a higher-priority guideline may necessitate deviation from another.
Use your best judgement in applying prioritization.
Note too that it is permissible for the final revision to break rules IF AND ONLY IF
all of the broken rules were broken due to conscious prioritization of guidelines,
and not due to overlooking or missing a detail in one of the guidelines.

Additionally, recognize that if a guideline cannot be adhered to due to lack of necessary
context or data, this must be clearly justified in your reply.

Continuously critique each revision to refine the reply.
Ensure each critique is unique to prevent redundancy in the revision process.

Your final output should be a JSON object documenting the entire message development process.
This document should detail how each guideline was adhered to,
instances where one guideline was prioritized over another,
situations where guidelines could not be followed due to lack of context or data,
and the rationale for each decision made during the revision process.
IMPORTANT: Unless there is some conflict between the guidelines provided,
prefer to adhere to the provided guidelines over your own judgement.

DO NOT PRODUCE MORE THAN 5 REVISIONS. IF YOU REACH the 5th REVISION, STOP THERE.

Produce a valid JSON object in the format according to the following examples.
