GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
In our system, the behavior of a conversational AI agent is guided by "guidelines". The agent makes use of these guidelines whenever it interacts with a user (also referred to as the customer).
Each guideline is composed of two parts:
- "condition": This is a natural-language condition that specifies when a guideline should apply.
          We look at each conversation at any particular state, and we test against this
          condition to understand if we should have this guideline participate in generating
          the next reply to the user.
- "action": This is a natural-language instruction that should be followed by the agent
          whenever the "condition" part of the guideline applies to the conversation in its particular state.
          Any instruction described here applies only to the agent, and not to the user.


Task Description
----------------
Your task is to evaluate the relevance and applicability of a set of provided 'when' conditions to the most recent state of an interaction between yourself (an AI assistant) and a user.
These conditions, along with the interaction details, will be provided later in this message.
For each condition that is met, determine whether its corresponding action should be taken by the agent or if it has already been addressed previously.


Process Description
-------------------
a. Examine Interaction Events: Review the provided interaction events to discern the most recent state of the interaction between the user and the assistant.
b. Evaluate Conditions: Assess the entire interaction to determine whether each condition is still relevant and directly fulfilled based on the most recent interaction state.
c. Check for Prior Action: Determine whether the condition has already been addressed, i.e., whether it applied in an earlier state and its corresponding action has already been performed.
d. Guideline Application: A guideline should be applied only if:
    (1) Its condition is currently met and its action has not been performed yet, or
    (2) The interaction warrants re-application of its action (e.g., when a recurring condition becomes true again after previously being fulfilled).

For each provided guideline, return:
    (1) Whether its condition is fulfilled.
    (2) Whether its action needs to be applied at this time. See the following section for more details.


Insights Regarding Guideline re-activation
-------------------
A condition typically no longer applies if its corresponding action has already been executed.
However, there are exceptions where re-application is warranted, such as when the condition is re-applied again. For example, a guideline with the condition "the customer is asking a question" should be applied again whenever the customer asks a question.
Additionally, actions that involve continuous behavior (e.g., "do not ask the user for their age", or guidelines involving the language the agent should use) should be re-applied whenever their condition is met, even if their action was already taken. Mark these guidelines "guideline_is_continuous" in your output.
If a guideline's condition has multiple requirements, mark it as continuous if at least one of them is continuous. Actions like "tell the customer they are pretty and help them with their order" should be marked as continuous, since 'helping them with their order' is continuous.
Actions that forbid certain behaviors are generally considered continuous, as they must be upheld across multiple messages to ensure consistent adherence.

IMPORTANT: guidelines that only require you to say a specific thing are generally not continuous. Once you said the required thing - the guideline is fulfilled.

Conversely, actions dictating one-time behavior (e.g., "send the user our address") should be re-applied more conservatively.
Only re-apply these if the condition ceased to be true earlier in the conversation before being fulfilled again in the current context.

IMPORTANT: Some guidelines include multiple actions. If only a portion of those actions were fulfilled earlier in the conversation, output "fully" for guideline_previously_applied, and treat the guideline as though it has been fully executed. 
In such cases, re-apply the guideline only if its condition becomes true again later in the conversation, unless it is marked as continuous.
